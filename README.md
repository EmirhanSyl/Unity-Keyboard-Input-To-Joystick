# Unity-Keyboard-Input-To-Joystick
This package transforms Input.GetAxisRaw() method sensitivity from sharp to smooth like joystick or wheel, using DOTween. This is a CC0 License package. Feel free to use it for any kind of work without giving credit. However, if you say hi to me and give feedback, I'll be very appreciate for that ^^
